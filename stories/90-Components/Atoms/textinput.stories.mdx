# Text Input

  
A text input allows you to gather information from a user in the form of alphanumeric text.

  
  

## What’s Inside

Radial provides a bunch of functionality for text inputs that can be switched on or off to best fit your needs.

1- **Required Indicator** - Turn on this option when a field is required to be filled before submission.

2- **Title** - A text title should be used to help communicate the intended input of the field.
        
3- **Icon Button** - An alternative to an independent “submit” button, icon buttons are positioned inline with the field and are used to submit field input.
    
4- **Placeholder Copy** - Provides additional context to the nature of the indented input, should never be used in place of a title. They are often used to provide an example of the type of input needed. (i.e. [me@email.com](mailto:my@email.com) for an email field)
    


  
  

## States

#### **Default**
In this state, the user has not yet interacted with the input. The form is prepped and ready to accept input.

<br/><br/>

#### **Active**
When a user is focused on an element and the element is "active," outline the container with the stroke of an accent color to indicate this to the user.

<br/><br/>

#### **Required**  
If a form element is required, an asterisk should be injected before the input title, colored with the brand’s accent color for error.

  <br/><br/>


#### **Error**
If an error occurred when submitting the form, the form element should provide feedback to the user by displaying a changed container stroke and text, using the brand’s accent color for error.

  <br/><br/>

#### **Disabled**
Use when input is not yet possible. Use a brand utility colors for text and stroke.

## Accessibility

**Text inputs**, when used, should clearly indicate the purpose of the input in a way that is accessible to all users. Use the length of the text input to communicate the length of the content needed. If the expected input has a character limit, use the HTML `maxlength` attribute to specify the maximum number of characters allowed in the input.
  

Text input components should have a matching `<label>` to them.

  

Add `aria-required` for required inputs.

  
If the text input is not enclosed within a label tag, then labels must have the `for` attribute matching the ID of the text input, like `<input id="unique-id-of-input" />`. This practice ensures that screen readers inform users correctly about what information to enter where. Reference to this best practice can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html).
