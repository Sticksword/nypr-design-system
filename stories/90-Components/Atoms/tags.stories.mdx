# Tags

  
Tags are snippets of text used to label or categorize content. They originated in our design system for articles and editorial but can be used in other situations to help users differentiate between items, increase recognition, or add further context to content.

  

## Use In Editorial

Gothamist.com makes use of "tags" atoms as a way to describe content to a reader. These "tags" are used in a few different places across the site, including as the eyebrow/kicker over a thumbnail in an article card (1), the eyebrow/kicker on an article page (2), and as a way to display story tags at the bottom of an article page (3). Usually tags are linked as a way to drive users to an aggregation page where they can discover additional related content.

## Formatting

-   When writing text for tags, aim for brevity.
    
-   Use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.
    
-   Avoid phrases longer than three to five words.
    

  

## Color & Accessibility

The background color of a tag should use a brand primary or accent colors in a way that attracts attention to the object. Both text and background color must meet WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast requirement.
