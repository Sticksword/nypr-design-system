# Timestamp


Timestamp displays information related to the date or time.

  

## Fields

**Publish Date** - Time when the content was originally published.

**Updated Date** - Time when the content was last updated.

  

## Formatting
Timestamps follow a 12-hour clock and should include an a “am” or “pm” so it’s clear what time is being communicated. Capitalization of "am" or "pm" is left to the discretion of the brand.

If time is within the current **year**, do not display the year, format like: "Month D, h:mm a"

If time is **more than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "Month D, YYYY h:mm a"

If time is **less than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "N hours ago"

If time is **less than** or equal to 5 minutes in the past format like: "Just Now"
