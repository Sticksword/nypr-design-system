# Cards

A card is a small grouping of related information. Generally this component is built out as a summary to link users to additional related content. These cards use flexible layouts, spanning a max-width of 10 columns (desktop) on the grid, but having a min-width of 4 columns (desktop)

## Card Types
There are two different types of cards: Horizontal (Primary and Secondary) and Vertical cards. Either of the cards should be used whenever they help fill the area they're being displayed in. For example: Horizontal cards should be utilized when the space that needs to be filled is horizontal, and vice versa for Vertical cards.


A few examples of cards that exist can be seen below
