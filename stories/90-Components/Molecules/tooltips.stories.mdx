## Tooltip vs Drawer Menu

Drawer menu are just that, menus. Typically a list of options or interactive elements that provide a user with jumping-off point. Menus are important to a user’s experience in navigation.

Tooltips are floating pieces of helpful information. They aren’t typically interactive and their content should be helpful, but never critical to a users experience.
  

## Variants

Tooltips can vary functionally by their configuration or stylistically by their brand. This includes typography, color, padding, and the optional link button or primary CTA. See the examples below for Whitelabel (left) vs. Gothamist (right).

## Placement

Tooltips should always be positioned next to the element it is connected to. Icon tooltips and interactive tooltips may be positioned top, bottom, left, or right to the trigger item. The position will vary depending on where the element is in relation to the edge of the screen.
