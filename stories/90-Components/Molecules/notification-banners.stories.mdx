# Notification Banners

Neilson defines a notifications as “informational messages that alert the user of general occurrences within a system.”. Similarly, Notifications Banners are not tied to user input current activity, but can inform the user of a change on the website or of an event that may be of interest. View a few examples of our Notification Banners in use below. Notification banners are usually dismissable, and are flexible in that only one element is required to be able to publish.

Examples of our different Notification Banner types are listed below.

### Notification Banner Variation Examples

## Product Marketing Banner (Top)

The Product Marketing banner will be used to house these communications when necessary.

## Breaking News Banner

The Breaking News Banner will be used to display important developing news stories that matter to our users in a prominent placement, alerting users to growing news stories as they develop. As a news organization, it is incredibly important to surface important news stories in a prominent position.  When the Breaking News Banner is live, it will appear across all site pages at the very top of the page under the Header.
