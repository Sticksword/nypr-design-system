# Notification Banners

Neilson defines a notifications as “informational messages that alert the user of general occurrences within a system.”. Similarly, Notifications Banners are not tied to user input current activity, but can inform the user of a change on the website or of an event that may be of interest. View a few examples of our Notification Banners in use below. Notification banners are usually dismissable, and are flexible in that only one element is required to be able to publish.

Examples of our different Notification Banner types are listed below.
