# Callout Banners

Neilson defines a notifications as “informational messages that alert the user of general occurrences within a system.”. Similarly, Callout Banners are not tied to user input current activity, but can inform the user of a change on the website or of an event that may be of interest. View a few examples of our Callout Banners in use below. Callout banners are usually dismissable, and are flexible in that only one element is required to be able to publish.

Examples of our different Callout Banner types are listed below.



## Product Marketing Banner (Top)

There will be times when the Product team or larger organization will need to communicate with NYPR users across all site pages, such as in the case of a change to our Privacy Policy or an update on communication frequency. The Product Marketing banner will be used to house these communications when necessary.
