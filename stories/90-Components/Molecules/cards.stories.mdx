# Cards

Cards are a type of container that hold content, acting as an entry point to more detailed information.


## Overview

Cards hold related information like text or images while providing functionality through links and buttons. Information held in cards should be scannable and easily digestible. If an article is the full meal, cards are merely a snack.

  

## Anatomy

Radial allows for flexible card functionality with elements that can be switched on or off to best fit your needs.

> **Image** - This should relate to the information in the card. Follow your brand’s size guidelines.
> 
> **Tag Label** - If your site supports tagging or "Categories," this Tag Label is made visible here. Keep tags as short as possible -- if a tag is longer than three words, follow the brand's rules on abbreviation and truncation.
> 
> **Title** - Every card needs a title! Cards have been designed to handle titles spanning multiple lines.
> 
> **Subtitle** - Subtitles can be used to add extra context or categorization to the card Title. 
> 
> **Body** - More information can be placed here. The ideal body length is about the same of a tweet (140 Characters). If the body is longer, follow the brand's rules on abbreviation and truncation.
>   
> **Button** - Used as a card's primary (and only) CTA. Following the Button component, this must be tied to an action and named as such.
> 
> **Metadata** - This small text field can be used for short form information like a date stamp or comment count.

  

## Usage

Use cards to display a group or list of related information as entry points to more information (i.e. news stories, podcasts, or a detailed group of options).

## Sizing & Grids

Cards use flexible layouts, spanning a max-width of 10 columns (desktop) on the grid, but having a min-width of 4 columns (desktop). Radial provides cards in two preset sizes, small and large. Large cards are meant to add prominence to content and can handle more elements, while small cards work better with less information in them.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Cards

Radial uses two different card layouts, Horizontal and Vertical, to provide flexible arrangement. The biggest differentiator between the two layouts is the image placement in relation to text content. Vertically, they’re stacked on top of eachother. Horizontally, they’re side by side. Vertical cards are more suited to a grid arrangement and look better next to each other, while horizontal cards are made specifically for stacking in a list format. Horizontal and vertical layouts follow the same stacking behavior on mobile.
