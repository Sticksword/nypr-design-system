# Cards

Cards are tupperware containers for your information, albeit not microwave safe.

## Overview

Cards hold related information like text or images while providing functionality through links and buttons. Information held in cards should be scannable and easily digestible. If an article is a full meal, cards are merely a snack.

  

## Anatomy

Radial allows for card functionality that can be switched on or off to best fit your needs.

> **Image** - This should relate to the information in the card. Follow your brand’s size guidelines.
> 
> **Tag** - If your site supports tagging, this Tag is made visible here. Keep tags 1-2 words.
> 
> **Title** - Every card needs a title! Cards have been designed to handle titles spanning multiple lines.
> 
> **Subtitle** - Subtitles can be used to add extra context or categorization to the card Title. 
> 
> **Body** - More information can be placed here. The ideal body length is about the same of a tweet (140 Characters)
>   
> **Button** - Used as a card's primary (and only) CTA. Following the Button component, this must be tied to an action and named as such.
> 
> **Metadata** - This small text field can be used for short form information like a date stamp or comment count.

  

## Usage

Use cards to display a group or list of related information as entry points to more information (i.e. news stories, podcasts, or a detailed group of options).

## Sizing & Grids

Cards use flexible layouts, spanning a max-width of 10 columns (desktop) on the grid, but having a min-width of 4 columns (desktop). Radial provides cards in two preset sizes, small and large. Large cards are meant to handle more options, while small cards work better with less information in them.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Cards

Radial uses two different card layouts, Horizontal and Vertical, to provide flexible arrangement. The biggest differentiator between the two layouts is the image placement in relation to text content. Vertically, they’re stacked on top of eachother. Horizontally, they’re side by side. Vertical cards are more suited to a grid arrangement and look better next to each other, while horizontal cards are made specifically for stacking in a list format.
