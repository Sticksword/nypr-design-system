# Drawer Menu

Drawer menus display interactive content like buttons or menu options in a floating container when triggered.

  

## Use Cases

-   Presenting selectable options to a user that don’t always need to be visible
    
-   Hide controls or functionality to be shown only when needed.
    

  

## Drawer Menu vs Tooltip

Drawer menus can be a list of options or interactive elements that provide a user with a jumping-off point. Menus are important to a user’s experience in navigation.

  

Tooltips are floating pieces of helpful information. They aren’t typically interactive and their content should be helpful, but never critical to a users experience.

  

## Placement

Drawer menus should always be positioned above or below to the element they are connected to. The position will vary depending on where the element is in relation to the edge of the screen.

  

## Motion

Animation for drawer menus comes into play when the menu is activated. Use our preset Incoming and Outgoing easing tokens to make drawer menus appear and disappear.

  

## Variants

Drawer menus can vary by their configuration or stylistically by their brand. This includes typography, color, padding, and iconography. See the examples below.

## Accessibility

Drawer menus are viewable on click of the element there connected to, this functionality gives viewability to all users, even those not using a mouse.
