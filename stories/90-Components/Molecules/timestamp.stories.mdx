# Timestamp


Timestamp displays information related to the date or time. Current usage includes, but is not limited to, time metadata in the [Article Metadata](https://nypublicradio.github.io/nypr-design-system/?path=/docs/components-molecules-article-metadata--page) and [Card](https://nypublicradio.github.io/nypr-design-system/?path=/docs/components-molecules-cards--page) components. 


  

## Fields
This component includes two time slots for time, we reccomend using them as laid out below. 

**Publish Date** - Time when the content was originally published.

**Updated Date** - Time when the content was last updated.

  

## Formatting Time
Timestamps follow a 12-hour clock and should include an a “am” or “pm” so it is clear what time is being communicated. Capitalization of "am" or "pm" is left to the discretion of the brand. Time is displayed according to a users timezone, a variable handled by Aviary.

If time is within the current **year**, do not display the year, format like: "Month D, h:mm a"

If time is **more than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "Month D, YYYY h:mm a"

If time is **less than** 24 hrs in the past format like: "N hours ago"

*If time is **less than** or equal to 5 minutes in the past format like: "Just Now"

*Just Now is best used with time-sensitive content like front page news or new content. This formatting option should be able to be turned on and off.

## Formatting Date
Date terminals such as "th" or "st” (ex: April 30th) are not used. Days of the week should never be abbreivaited and can be turned on and off as needed.
