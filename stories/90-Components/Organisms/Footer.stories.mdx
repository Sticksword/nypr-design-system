# Footers

## Overview

Footers live at the bottom of every webpage and contain the global navigation, secondary links, CTAs, and smaller molecules. These page components are important for navigation, giving users a clear list of options when they reach the bottom of the page.

  

## What’s Inside

1. 1 - **Brand Placeholder** - Placeholder for logo of respective brand

2. 2 - **Property Description** - Short description of the website

3. 3 - **Primary Navigation** - Top level links to larger areas of a site’s domain

4. 4 - **Vertical Component Area** - Flexible area for custom components to be dropped in as needed

5. 5 - **Legal Links and Attribution** - Placeholder area for legalese and links.

6. 6 - **NYPR Brand Roll** - Collection of the NYPR family of properties.

7. 7 - **Horizontal Component Area** - Flexible area for custom components to be dropped in as needed.

8. 8 - **Social Links** - Link off to a brand's social media accounts

9. 9 - **Secondary Navigation** - Links to inner site pages or lower-level areas of the site


  ## Configurations

Much like our other larger organisms, sections of the footer component can be turned on and off to suit the needs of a brand. Two areas for additional components provide further flexibility. Below are some examples of footer configurations done by toggling molecules off and on.

  ## Responsive Sizing

While the footer is always full-width, sections can condense and stack as the screen size gets narrower. Smaller breakpoints like tablet (1) and mobile (2) are separate components in our Figma library. Note that in mobile, our legal text bumps past other molecules to remain at the bottom of the footer.
