# Footers

## Overview

Footers live at the bottom of every webpage and contain the global navigation, secondary links, CTAs, and smaller molecules. These page components are important for navigation, giving users a clear list of options when they reach the bottom of the page.

  

## What’s Inside
Radial’s default footer includes placeholders for branding, a brief description, primary/secondary navigation, and social links. It also contains two areas for additional components to be dropped in as needed. 

At a minimum, a footer should contain top-level navigational links in parity with the Site Header. A footer should also always include branding of the respective brand in the "Brand Placeholder" area.

1- **Brand Placeholder** - Placeholder for logo of respective brand

2- **Property Description** - Short description of the site and/or brand/organization.

3- **Primary Navigation** - Top level links to larger areas of a site’s domain. Also called "Global Navigation." Use this area for links before using the Secondary Navigation.

4- **Vertical Component Area** - Flexible area for interactive components, such as buttons or form fields, can be optionally included in the footer depending on site goals.

5- **Copyright Text, Attribution, and Legal Links** - Placeholder area for copyright and legal links (ex: © 2020 New York Public Radio)

6- **NYPR Brand Roll** - Standardized copy and list with links to all NYPR properties; a requirement for Comscore audience counting.

7- **Horizontal Component Area** - Another flexible area for custom components to be dropped in as needed. (ex: Sign Up Form, Search, Donate Button, etc)

8- **Social Links** - Link off to a brand's social media accounts

9- **Secondary Navigation** - Links to inner site pages or lower-level areas of the site, includes optional subheader.

 ## Configurations

Much like our other larger organisms, sections of the footer component can be turned on and off to suit the needs of a brand. Two areas for additional components provide further flexibility. Below are some examples of footer configurations done by toggling molecules off and on.

&nbsp;
<img alt="footer2 config" src="./images/Organisms-Footer -Desktop-2.png" width="500" />

  ## Responsive Sizing

While the footer is always full-width, sections can condense and stack as the screen size gets narrower. Smaller breakpoints like tablet (1) and mobile (2) are separate components in our Figma library. Note that in mobile, our legal text bumps past other molecules to remain at the bottom of the footer.

## TBD Future Notes Section
Area to include notes about future iterations to this atom, quantitative or qualitative research related to the atom, or more. Fancy section name to come.
