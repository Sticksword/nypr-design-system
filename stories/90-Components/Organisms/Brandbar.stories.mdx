# Brand Bar

## Overview

Brand bars serve as the primary navigation for NYPR web properties. They are always top aligned, they are always navigation focused, they are always on brand. #onbrand

## What’s Inside

Our whitelable Brand Bar component includes a hamburger menu, placeholders for branding, primary navigation, social links, a primary CTA, a search icon and form field, and a progress bar for article pages. These items are optional to be turned on or off based on the page experience and content.

1. 1 - Hamburger Menu - If a site supports sidebar menus, the hamburger navigation is used to launch the menu. More typically seen on mobile where navigation items are shifted from brand bar to side menu.

2. 2- Brand Placeholder - Placeholder for logo of respective site/brand.

3. 3- Primary Links - Top level links to larger areas of a site’s domain.

4. 4- Social Icons - Link off to a brand's social media accounts. On an article page, these can be replaced with "Share" functionality.

5. 5- Primary CTA - Used most times for donate call-to-actions.

6. 6- Search - Icon that launches a form field on click. This action hides all items on the right side of the brand bar to make visual space for the search field.

  

## States

Depending on the platform, a brand bar can have a number of configurations (states). In Gothamist, the brand bar swaps its primary navigation for the article headline and share tools when on an article page. When the search state is active, neighboring components hide themselves to make room for the added field. Configuration options are built into our whitelabel component and will expand as we incorporate more brands into Radial. See possible configurations below.

## Behaviors

By default, Brand Bars are sticky, keeping the component accessible from anywhere on a page without having to scroll.

  

## Mobile

On mobile, the majority of components in the brand bar will be hidden as to fit the smaller screensoze. In these cases, a Side Menu can be triggered via a hamburger menu or similar icon to show primary and secondary navigation items. In the whitelabel, only the hambuger menu, branding, and primary CTA are shown at a mobile width.
