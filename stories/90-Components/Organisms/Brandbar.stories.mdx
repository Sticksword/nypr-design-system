# Brand Bar

## Overview

Brand bars serve as the primary navigation for web properties. They’re always top aligned, they’re always navigation focused, they’re always on brand. #onbrand

## What’s Inside

Our whitelable Brand Bar component includes a hamburger menu, placeholders for branding, primary navigation, social links, a primary CTA, and a progress bar for articles pages.

1. 1- Hamburger Menu - If a site supports side menus, hamburgers are used to trigger their entry. More typically seen on mobile where navigation items are shifted from brand bar to side menu.

2. 2- Brand Placeholder - Placeholder for logo of respective brand.

3. 3- Primary Links - Top level links to larger areas of a site’s domain

4. 4- Social Icons - Links off to a brands social media accounts

5. 5- Primary CTA - Used most times for donate call-to-actions.

6. 6- Search - Icon that launches a text-field on click. This action hides all items on the right side of the brand bar to make visual space for the search field.

  

## States

Depending on the platform, a brand bar can have a number of configurations (states). In Gothamist, our brand bar swaps it’s primary navigation for a headline when on an article page. When the search state is active, neighboring components hide themselves to make room. Configuration options are built-in to our whitelabel component and will expand as we incorporate more brands into Radial. See possible configurations below.

## Behaviors

By default, Brand Bars are sticky, keeping the component accessible from anywhere on a page without having to scroll.

  

## Mobile

On mobile, brand bars can hide the majority of their components to fit the narrow screen. In these cases, a Side Menu can be triggered via a hamburger menu or similar icon to show primary and secondary navigation. In our whitelabel bar, only the hambuger menu, branding, and primary CTA are shown at a mobile width.
