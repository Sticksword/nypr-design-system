## Summary: Top 10 Tips for Improving Your Newsletter


1.  **Understand how your newsletter is performing:** set goals and track key metrics over time  
      
2.  **Always be growing:** announce on your show, promote on social channels, work with colleagues to cross-promote  
    
4.  **Ask for consent before adding people to your list:** no spam here    
    
5.  **Welcome newcomers:** send a series of welcome e-mails and help newbies understand more about your newsletter, NYPR, etc.  
         
6.  **Be predictable:** stick to a sending schedule and frequency  
         
7.  **Make it readable and useable:** use mobile-friendly design, clear headers/headlines for easy scanning, and buttons for clickable calls to action  
       
8.  **Be engaging and create paths for participation:** ask for feedback (and respond thoughtfully), pose a question, post something a reader sent in  
      
    
9.  **Always be testing:** experiment with subject lines, formats, designs, adding or removing sections, and measure the results to find out what works and what doesn’t  
    
10.  **More subscribers isn’t always better:** perform regular list maintenance and ask folks who rarely open to unsubscribe from your experience  
    
11.  **Offboard like a champ:** remind folks who unsubscribe of the other ways they can stay in touch (other less frequent NYPR newsletters, social channels, etc)

## Establishing Goals
### Goals give us purpose and direction. Key Metrics tell us if we are meeting our goals.

- Establish goals and key metrics for your newsletter by answering these questions:
- Why are we investing time and effort in creating these e-mails?
- What outcomes are we expecting from our e-mails?
- What determines a successful e-mail or newsletter? 
- How can we measure this? 
- How will we know if we are doing well or if we need to change course? 
- What are reasonable growth figures to aim for?

### Key Metrics must be monitored over time. “Set it and forget it” mentality won’t help your list improve. 

Tips:
- Try creating Audience segments and scheduling snapshots in Comparative Reports in Mailchimp
- Monitor and record your stats on a weekly or monthly basis
- Keep a shared stats doc that you update and share with your team (be transparent about your stats collection methodology to help colleagues understand the sources of your numbers): [here’s a sample newsletter stats template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gbyIkSpyqcNmsmmyT5mxwGkmiT2bxelhj8Z6YAVYy08/edit?usp=sharing) you can copy and use

### Want to start a new e-mail list? Answer these questions first.

- **Who is the audience you want to target? Be specific.** Think about age, geography, content preferences, reading habits, etc. What evidence do you have that this group would be well-served by a newsletter?
- **What is your value proposition?** What makes your newsletter different from the 3 zillion other newsletters that already exist (or the many that NYPR is already sending)? What specific need would your newsletter serve for your audience? What problem would your newsletter solve for them? What gap would it fill?
- **What is your primary outcome or goal?** How will you know if your newsletter is successful? (see previous slides)
- **How will you resource this effort?** How many hours per week will this require? Who will respond to reader feedback or questions? Who will fill in if someone is on vacation? Who will be in charge of tracking metrics?
- **How will you promote this newsletter?**

> **Perhaps a new list isn’t the answer…**
> 
> Is there an existing list that you could use to promote your content
> instead of creating a new list?
> 
> Did you check to see if any of NYPR’s existing but dormant lists may
> be appropriate for refreshing? 
> 
> Is promoting on a social channel more likely to get the attention you
> want?
