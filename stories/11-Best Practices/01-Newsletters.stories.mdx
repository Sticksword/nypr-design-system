## Summary: Top 10 Tips for Improving Your Newsletter


1.  **Understand how your newsletter is performing:** set goals and track key metrics over time  
      
2.  **Always be growing:** announce on your show, promote on social channels, work with colleagues to cross-promote  
    
4.  **Ask for consent before adding people to your list:** no spam here    
    
5.  **Welcome newcomers:** send a series of welcome e-mails and help newbies understand more about your newsletter, NYPR, etc.  
         
6.  **Be predictable:** stick to a sending schedule and frequency  
         
7.  **Make it readable and useable:** use mobile-friendly design, clear headers/headlines for easy scanning, and buttons for clickable calls to action  
       
8.  **Be engaging and create paths for participation:** ask for feedback (and respond thoughtfully), pose a question, post something a reader sent in  
      
    
9.  **Always be testing:** experiment with subject lines, formats, designs, adding or removing sections, and measure the results to find out what works and what doesn’t  
    
10.  **More subscribers isn’t always better:** perform regular list maintenance and ask folks who rarely open to unsubscribe from your experience  
    
11.  **Offboard like a champ:** remind folks who unsubscribe of the other ways they can stay in touch (other less frequent NYPR newsletters, social channels, etc)
