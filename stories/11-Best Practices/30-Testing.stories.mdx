# Testing Best Practices

Product, Design, and Engineering need a way to answer hypotheses, empathize with users, and save Engineering time spent iterating. Of those listed, all can be accounted for when factoring a Testing Strategy into projects. The Digital team strives to be a data-driven, user-centric team that integrates testing & research into our product design and development process.

We strongly support usability testing best practices prior to any implementation of platform iteration and/or innovation. These methods allow for efficient evaluation of design hypothesis and/or identification of opportunities for improvements to inform solutions that will be additive to the overall user experience (and at the same time, accomplish business goals).

### Testing Principles

**If you have a question, run a test.** Pretty self-explanitory.

**Create research tickets.** Research is time intensive, understand that research can take various forms of fidelity (ex. Gorilla, vs Formal) and try to account for the appropriate amount of time needed to complete your resaerch project.

**Write a Report.** TBDTBD

**Include Stakeholders in your research efforts** TBDTBD

**Make Research a part of the begining, middle, and end of every project.** TBD


## Table of Suggested Tests & Methodologies
The list below is not an exhaustive list, but contains a few of popular tests and techniques that the Digital team has used in the past to help answer questions. Please add to this list if any are missing. 

| Test or Technique  | Type | Tools | Effort | Best Time to Run |
|--------------------|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Sentiment Analysis**<br/> Understand user emotions within qualitative feedback, usually a survey. <br/>`Design` | `Exploratory` | Usability Hub <br/> Hotjar <br/> Google Forms <br/>Survey Monkey | ðŸ’š Low | `Beginning`, `End` |
| **Personas**<br/> A fictional character created with qualitative data to represent a group of segmented user types, often based on usage of your product.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Exploratory` | Usertesting.com <br/> User Interviews <br/> Figma <br/> Miro | ðŸ”¸ Medium to ðŸ”º High | `Beginning` |
| **Archetypes**<br/> Quantitative-based behavioral perspectives of users towards a specific product around a group's needs, motivations and pain-points.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Exploratory` | Usertesting.com <br/> User Interviews <br/> Figma <br/> Miro | ðŸ’š Low to ðŸ”¸ Medium | `Beginning` |
| **Shadowing**<br/> When a researcher accompanies the user and observes how they use the product or service within their natural environment.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Exploratory` | Usertesting.com <br/> Rainbow Spreadsheet <br/> Trello <br/> Miro | ðŸ”¸ Medium | `Beginning` |
| **A/B Testing**<br/> A randomized experiment with two or more variants, used to test a hypothesis.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Evaluation` | Google Optimize | ðŸ’š Low to ðŸ”¸ Medium | `Middle`, `End` |
| **Secondary Research Gathering**<br/> The summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Exploratory` | Our Research Repositiory, <br/> Data Team,<br/> Pew Research Studies,<br/> Edison Data,<br/> Nielson Studies,<br/> The Internet | ðŸ’š Low | `Beginning` |
| **Interviews**<br/> A research method involving a researcher asking a user questions with the goal of learning more about that user or the effacy of a product they are using.  <br/>`Design`, `Product` | `Exploratory`, `Evaluation` | Usertesting.com,<br/> Rainbow Spreadsheet,<br/> Trello, <br/> Zoom, <br/> NYPR Meeting Room or Room Rental | ðŸ”¸ Medium to ðŸ”º High | `Beginning`, `Middle`, `End` |
