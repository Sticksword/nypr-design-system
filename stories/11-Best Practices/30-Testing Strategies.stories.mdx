# Testing Strategy Best Practices

**Our Methodology**

Product designers (and those they team up with) need to have empathy for their users. We frequently need to switch lenses, to see our work from other perspectives. To do this effectively, we strive to be a data-driven, user-centric team that integrates testing & research into our product design and development process.

We strongly support usability testing best practices prior to the implementation of platform iteration and innovation. These methods allow for efficient evaluation of design hypothesis and/or identification of opportunities for improvements to inform solutions that will be additive to the overall user experience (and at the same time, accomplish business goals).
