# Welcome to Radial

Design systems are made up of building blocks that help organizations build scalable, user-centric, data-driven products. This is the framework that we will use to build, iterate and optimize digital experiences, extend brand identity, deliver consistent UI/UX patterns, and optimize process across disciplines. With a customizable design system in place, we can deliver best-in-class (radio, podcast and news) content, membership, and ad experience across our platforms that will delight and inform our audiences.

# New York Public Radio's Design Principles

The Radial Design System consists of the user-focused design patterns and components that power the digital presence of our brands. These principles and our library of components provide the framework to build great storytelling platforms and a cohesive user experience. The team uses these principles as filters to determine what goes into the system, what’s custom and what is not.
