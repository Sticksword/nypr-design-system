### Gothamist Palette

Our no-nonsense civic-minded palette for Gothamist focuses on text content and headlines while accenting with color that reminds us of the warm asphalt jungle that is NYC.

**Banana Yellow** is the primary color used for accents, emphasis, and CTAs. **Reddish Orange** is also used for CTAs and actions related to donating or membership. **WNYC Red** is self-explanatory. **Gray Dark** is the primary header and body text color. **Gray** is used for certain icons, and **Dirty Salmon** is used for header underlines and emphasis. **Dusk Blue** is used for important banners, Purple for things relating to sponsored content, and **Taxicab Yellow** for highlighted container backgrounds (banners, signup cards, etc.)

### Golor Groups
Color groups help pretermine foreground colors based on background color. Gothamist has two color groups, light and dark.

## Borders

Borders give structure and decoration to elements and containers when needed. They’re not always necessary, but can be a useful tool in the right scenario, like a potato masher.

### Usage

Currently, borders are actively used in Gothamist in text decoration, buttons, and banners. Dashed styles in this case are important to the brand’s online expression.

### Styles

Radial offers three slots for borders styles: **subtle**, **normal**, and **bold**. Each style has its own color variable, and each style can be customized (i.e. width, style, and color) to suit a brand's theme.

The Whitelabel styles shown below are only to communicate best practices for the three set styles, **subtle** being the least visually commanding of the three, **bold** being the most. When customizing these borders, make sure the style roughly fits into one of the three naming conventions, relative to the other two.

| Border Name | Border Properties | Border Example |
