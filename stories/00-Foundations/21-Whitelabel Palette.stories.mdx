### Whitelabel Palette

Our Whitelabel uses a minimal yet functional palette to communicate best practices of Primary, Utility, and Accent colors.

WHITELABEL COLOR SWATCHES  (PRIMARY / UTILITY / ACCENT)

| Color Swatch Type | Color Swatch Examples |
| -- | -- |
| Primary | <div style={{"display":"flex"}}> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-ceramic-blue" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-cool-blue" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-sky-blue" /> </div> |
| Utility | <div style={{"display":"flex"}}> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-gray-dark" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-concrete" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-cool-white" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-white" /> </div> |
| Accent | <div style={{"display":"flex"}}> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-ember-red" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-sea-green" /> <ColorSwatch colorToken="--color-bright-purple" /> </div> |

**Cool Blue** is the primary color for CTAs, buttons, or interactive elements. **Ceramic Blue** can be used as a header color or background color for larger, prominent components. **Sky Blue** is purely a decorative lighter alternative. **Gray Dark** is our primary text color, including headers, body text, and small text. **Cool White** is an alternative background-color. **Ember Red** is used solely for errors or warnings and **Sea Green** for success messaging or confirmations.

### Gothamist Palette

Our no-nonsense civic-minded palette for Gothamist focuses on text content and headlines while accenting with color that reminds us of the warm asphalt jungle that is NYC.

GOTHAMIST COLOR SWATCHES (PRIMARY / UTILITY / ACCENT)

| Color Swatch Type | Color Swatch Examples |
| -- | -- |
| Primary | COLOR SWATCHES HERE |
| Utility | COLOR SWATCHES HERE |
| Accent | COLOR SWATCHES HERE |


**Banana Yellow** is the primary color used for accents, emphasis, and CTAs. **Reddish Orange** is also used for CTAs and actions related to donating or membership. **WNYC Red** is self-explanatory. **Gray Dark** is the primary header and body text color. **Gray** is used for certain icons, and **Dirty Salmon** is used for header underlines and emphasis. **Dusk Blue** is used for important banners, Purple for things relating to sponsored content, and **Taxicab Yellow** for highlighted container backgrounds (banners, signup cards, etc.)

### Themes
Color groups help pretermine foreground colors based on background color. Gothamist has two color groups, light and dark. 

#### Light

## Borders

Borders give structure and decoration to elements and containers when needed. They’re not always necessary, but can be a useful tool in the right scenario, like a potato masher.

### Usage

Currently, borders are actively used in Gothamist in text decoration, buttons, and banners. Dashed styles in this case are important to the brand’s online expression.

### Styles

Radial offers three slots for borders styles: **subtle**, **normal**, and **bold**. Each style has its own color variable, and each style can be customized (i.e. width, style, and color) to suit a brand's theme.
  
The Whitelabel styles shown below are only to communicate best practices for the three set styles, **subtle** being the least visually commanding of the three, **bold** being the most. When customizing these borders, make sure the style roughly fits into one of the three naming conventions, relative to the other two.

| Border Name | Border Properties | Border Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| --b-border-subtle | 2px, dashed (3,3) | EXAMPLE OF BORDER STYLE HERE |
| --b-border-normal | 3px, solid | EXAMPLE OF BORDER STYLE HERE |
| --b-border-bold | 5px, dashed (10,10) |  EXAMPLE OF BORDER STYLE HERE |
