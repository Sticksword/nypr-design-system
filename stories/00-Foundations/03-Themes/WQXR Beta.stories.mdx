# WQXR Beta

## Branding
![enter image description here](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Branding for WQXR Beta is the same as WQXR.org. It features both a color and B&W version.
## Typography
WQXR uses two typefaces to show clear hierarchy and promote the readability of content in our audio focused experience. Playfair Display is used as our default primary font for headlines and titles. Open Sans is used as our default secondary and tertiary font for body text as well as small headers and info text.

## Color Pallete
Our cool and calming color palette for WQXR is meant to relax and invite users to our audio-focused, classical music experience.
