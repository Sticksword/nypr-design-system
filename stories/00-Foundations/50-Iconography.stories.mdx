# Iconography

Icons reduce cognitive load by supplementing context and meaning to UI. Good icons are quickly recognizable, afford interactivity, and add visual interest. Icons, like salt, perform best when used sparingly and purposefully. Do not oversalt your designs.

## Usage

Radial uses SVG icons across all brands, many of them sourced from [https://thenounproject.com/](https://thenounproject.com/)


## Accessibility

If an icon is used without accompanying text, a title attribute is needed on the containing element.

Icons that are interactive must follow the same WCAG 2.0 contrast standards as typography, requiring a minimum contrast ratio 3.0. Non-interactive icons like status symbols or brand logos don’t need to follow these standards.

## Sizing

Our default icons come in four sizes: 16px (XS), 24px (S), 32px (M), and 40px (L). These sizes are the dimensions of the SVG and include the icon as well as the padding. This consistency helps when sourcing third party icons. Larger sizes may be available to other brands. 

| Size | Measurement | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| XS | 16px | ICON |
| S | 24px | ICON |
| M | 32px | ICON |
| L | 40px | ICON |

When creating new icons, padding can be determined by using at least ⅛ of the icon frame’s width.
