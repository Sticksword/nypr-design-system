# Step by Step Example

Lets create a 'tag' component. This is basically a link with some special styling.

## Name the Component

Radial uses three atomic prefixes for components:

  The categories are a bit fuzzy, especially molecules and organisms, but here are some rules of thumb.

- `nypr-a-` for atoms. These are the base unit of component. They shouldn't contain other components.
- `nypr-m-` for molecules. These are components built out of mutliple atoms.
- `nypr-o-` for organisms. These are components built by combining molecules or organisms with other components.

  Our 'tag' component isn't build out of any other components so we'll consider it an atom so we'll call it `nypr-a-tag`.

## Create the ember component
	Run the command `ember generate component nypr-a-tag`
	This will create a js and hbs template for your component.



## Create a basic story file

A *story* is a specific example of how to use a component.

A *story file* is a file with a `.stories.js` extension where one or more stories are defined.

Let's add a story file for our tag component to the `/stories/Components/Atoms` folder

**/stories/Components/Atoms/nypr-a-button.js**
```js
import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile';

// The default export should be a js object defining metadata about your component.
export default {
    title: 'Components/Atoms/Tag',
    component: 'nypr-a-tag'
};

// A *story* is a function that returns a js object.
// This object should at minimum include a value for `template`.
// For more details see "Documenting Your Component"
export const Tag = () => ({
    template: hbs`
    <NyprATag class='tag--primary'>Primary Tag</NyprATag>
    `,
});
```

## Start Ember & Storybook

Start the ember server: `ember s`
While ember is still running, start storybook: `yarn storybook`

This should open a browser window with storybook in it.

## Build your component

Now you can edit your component and storybook will automatically update to show the current state of your component.

## Add CSS

Add an scss file in the `styles/components` folder with the same name as your component. 


**styles/components/_nypr-a-tag.scss**
```css
.nypr-a-tag {
    background-color: var(--c-brand1)
    color: var(--c-text)
}
```

Include this file in `styles/components/_config.imports.scss`

**/app/styles/components/_config.imports.scss`**
```scss
@import "components/nypr-a-tag";
```
