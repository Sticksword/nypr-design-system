# Setting Up your Environment For Local Development

1. Clone the repo

```git clone git@github.com:nypublicradio/nypr-design-system.git```

```cd nypr-design-system```

2. Checkout the radial branch

```git checkout radial```

(Temporary step until this is all merged into master)

3. Install dependencies

```yarn```

4. Install watchman if the project doesn't have it already 

```brew install watchman``` 

5. Start ember

```ember serve```

(*Storybook looks at the `/dist/` folder to find your ember components. If you're only working on documentation and not modifying ember components, you should be able to get away with only running `ember build`, but if you make any changes to ember code they won't be reflected in storybook until you build again.)

6. Run storybook

While ember is still running:

```yarn storybook```

Storybook will open automatically in your browser. You can now edit your components and stories and see the changes live.
