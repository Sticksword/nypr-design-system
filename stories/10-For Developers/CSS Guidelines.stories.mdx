# CSS Guidelines

## BEM class naming

We use them [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/naming/) for naming our CSS classes. 

## Prefixes

Inspired by the philosophy of ITSCSS, but modified to fit an atomic design pattern.

|prefix|name|description|
|---|---|---|
|`a-`| atom | styles specific to an atom |
|`m-`| molecule | styles specific to an molecule |
|`o-`| organism | styles specific to an organism |
|`l-`| layout | apply these to containers to create layouts |
|`u-`| utility | used to override defaults and apply other effects |
|`js-`| javascript | classes that are designed to be toggled by javascript |

## Avoid `&`, the Sass 'parent selector', especially as a class prefix.
The [Sass parent selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector) can be a nice shorcut for small blocks, but once a section of code is longer than will fit on the screen, it means you have to scroll up to see what it refers to. When used as part of a class names it also breaks searching for a specific class.

```sass
/* BAD */
.o-my-component {
    &__message {
        color: var(--c-alert);
    }
}

/* GOOD */
.o-my-component {
    .o-my-component__message {
        color: var(--c-alert);
    }
}
```
