# **Accessibility Best Practices, Process and Policy**


### Process
The NYPR digital team designs and builds websites and applications with accessibility best practices in mind, using a variety of tools to test compliance in all stages of the design and development process. Our goal is for all new products to be [WCAG 2.0 AA Compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
