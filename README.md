Home of the Radial Design system.

This repo contains an Ember addon, `nypr-design-system` and the files to 
power Storybook.



## Ember Addon


### Installation

*tktk*

## Storybook
The following folders contain files for storybook:

`stories`
`.storybook`

To run Storybook locally you need Ember to already be running (`ember serve`) or built (`ember build`). More specifically you need the Ember addon to exist in the `dist` folder, so it can read and display the Ember components. After that you can start storybook by running:

```bash
yarn storybook
```
